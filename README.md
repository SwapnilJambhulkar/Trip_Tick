## # Trip Tick App 🧳🏝

This React application simplifies trip packing with a checklist. Users can add items, specify quantity and name, and manage the list with checkboxes and a deletion option. Sorting options include by order, description, and packed status. A "Clear All" feature requires user confirmation before erasing the list. Real-time statistics at the bottom track the total items, packed items, and the completion percentage.
